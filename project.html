                <img src="/photos/Reunions-Pic-3.jpg" alt="Gallery 1">
                <p>Reunions are also a great opportunity to discover how fellow alumni are carrying the torch of INSEAD’s 
                    enduring vision and campaign, Business as a Force for Good. From integrating the Sustainable Development 
                    Goals into their businesses to walking the talk on gender equity in the workplace, 
                    INSEAD alumni embody the Force for Good spirit as agile business leaders who are helping to shape a better future.</p>

                <p>The year 2022 was an exceptional one for MBA class reunions. 
                    For the first time in the history of INSEAD, thousands of alumni and their families came back 
                    to Fontainebleau to be Together Again for a whopping 57 class reunions! Why so many in just one year?
                     The pandemic had forced the school to postpone class reunions for the last two years, 
                    leaving many of our alumni deeply missing the chance to reconnect with their classmates.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="gallery-item">
                <img src="/photos/Reunions-Pic-2 - Copy.jpg" alt="Gallery 3" height="200px">
                
                <p>A special highlight was the three MBA’60 alumni who returned for their 60-year reunion, 
                    illustrating how an INSEAD experience remains an unforgettable part of one’s life, regardless 
                    of the passage of time. Needless to say, emotions ran high as our alumni were finally able 
                    to rekindle their friendships, 
                    some after decades apart, over the course of a 3-day reunion designed to bring them Together Again.</p>
